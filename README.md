# [Project 1: Churn Rate analysis](https://github.com/IbnOladele/Power-BI_Projects)

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer churn and identify key drivers behind attrition. The dataset contained 6,687 customers, with an overall churn rate of 26.86% (1,796 churned customers).

Key insights from the analysis include:

* Churn Drivers: The main reasons for churn were competition (better offers, devices, or services), poor customer support, dissatisfaction, and pricing issues.

* Customer Segments:

 - Monthly contracts showed the highest churn rate (46%) compared to yearly contracts (~6%).

 - Senior customers had the highest churn (38%) compared to other demographics.

 - High churn was associated with customers facing higher charges and frequent service calls.

* Regional Trends: Churn varied across states, highlighting specific regions where customer retention strategies should be strengthened.

* Behavioral Insights: Customers without unlimited data plans and those with higher grouped consumption had higher churn tendencies.

The dashboard allows dynamic exploration of churn by demographics, contract type, payment method, service usage, and geography, giving stakeholders actionable insights to design retention strategies.

Tools Used: Power BI (data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals).
